I rewrote my resume in a new markup-based typesetting system called
[Typst](https://typst.app).

<!--more-->

My resume has been written in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) since
college. I found a template on [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com), tweaked it, and
added my information. LaTeX is a hard language to learn and become proficient
with. It is unlike any programming language I have ever used. The syntax is
extremely foreign, and creating development environments has been something I've
struggled with. I haven't touched LaTeX other than to create my resume, and
reports in college for a computer science class wich required them.

A couple months back, I had read about Typst. I thought it looked pretty
promising, but didn't really think anything else of it. Then about two weeks
ago, I decided that I wanted to learn something new, and I thought that Typst
might be the perfect opportunity. I wanted to try to rewrite my resume in it, so
that is what I set out to do for the next two weeks, which brings us to today.

I learned enough Typst to successfully create a resume I am proud of. It leans
heavily into my resume's previous design, but has some more design improvements.
With Typst, I was able to move all the content into [YAML](https://yaml.org/)
files, while keeping the style and layout in Typst files. Only having to update
a YAML file to edit my resume is going to be a great time-saver in the future; I
won't be needing to edit code.

Needless to say, I have completely fallen for Typst. It is an amazing
technology. If I ever need a typesetting system again, I know exactly what I
will be reaching for.

The source code for my resume is hosted on
[SourceHut](https://git.sr.ht/~tristan957/resume). A
[compiled PDF](/documents/Tristan_Partin_Resume.pdf) is hosted on this site if
you want to see how it turned out.

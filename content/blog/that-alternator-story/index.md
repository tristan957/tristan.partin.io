Last week I had to replace the alternator in my truck after I had put in a new
one about 18 months ago. I thought I would share the story of how that initial
alternator came to be.

The story starts on {{< time "February 10, 2022" >}}. In classic bachelor
fashion, I had no plans for the Valentine's Day weekend, and I knew my buddies
Will and Thomas didn't either. They lived in Dallas, and I lived in Austin. Waco
essentially splits the difference, so I came up with the ingenious idea to call
them to see if they wanted to meet in Waco for the weekend starting on Friday.
They enthusiastically said yes.

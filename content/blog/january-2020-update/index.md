I am failing at timely monthly blogs. November and December were a blur, so here
is January.

## Dallas Shenanigans

January started off with New Year's Eve in Dallas. I spent some time with some
friends. Stayed at my friend Will's place, and had a blast overall

### Scheel's

During my trip, I had the opportunity to stop at a sports and outdoors shop
names Scheel's that was so big it had a ferris wheel inside of it. I got to hold
some guns, which was something I hadn't done in a while. Felt pretty good to
hold them, and it was a reminder that I need to get some guns of my own and to
hit the range.

## Workation 2021

Besides various trips to visit friends, I am planning to go with some friends to
Maui for a 2-week workation. It will be an opportunity to get away from what is
actually a pretty mild winter, but also an opportunity to explore a little bit
of the world, which is something that COVID has taken away from me this past
year.

During my stay in Dallas and the week after, we finally had a good opportunity
to nail down some plans. Joseph did a good job finding cheap flights for us to
take, so I ended up getting a round trip ticket for $283 from Austin. I was
pretty excited about that, and I was able to use my credit card points for the
first time.

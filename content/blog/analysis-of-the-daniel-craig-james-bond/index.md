The Daniel Craig James Bond is an amazing departure from the James Bond of yore,
providing depth to the character that has never been seen before.

Since the mid-2000s, studios have been producing more adult versions of movies
featuring characters fans have known and loved. One of the most recognizable
instance that I am aware of is the Christian Bale Dark Knight trilogy. In a
similar vein, we've also seen Daniel Craig portray James Bond as this much
darker version of the character that has left fans in awe for the duration of
his portrayal.

James Bond is typically known as a quick-witted and mild-mannered seductionist
without a lot of depth. Rarely, does the audience see the vulnerability of Bond
throughout the franchise. After the Brosnan Bond era ended, we were left without
a Bond movie for a few years. Then, in 2006, _Casino Royale_ featuring Daniel
Craig as the latest iteration of the character splashed onto the scene.

## _Casino Royale_

The movie starts with a glimpse of Bond achieving his double-0 status, starting
his career with MI6. Early on into the movie, we understand a few
characteristics of Bond, which are fairly typical of him throughout the
franchise. He is cunning and disregards rules if it'll push the mission forward
or get him out of a sticky situation.

The movie continues, and Bond heads out to Montenegro to participate in Le
Chiffre's poker tournament. He is initially accompanied by Vesper Lynd, first
meeting on a train. On the train, there is a very important conversation that
happens between Vesper and Bond, where they read each other. Vesper provides
some great insight into Bond.

> By the cut of your suit, you went to Oxford or wherever, and actually think
> human beings dress like that. But you wear it with such disdain, my guess is
> you didn't come from money, and your school friends never let you forget it.
> Which means you were at that school by the grace of someone else's charity,
> hence the chip on your shoulder. And since your first thought about me ran to
> orphan, that's what I'd say you are.

Bond had a rough upbringing, losing his family and never really experiencing
love afterward. He was essentially groomed for his current role as a double-0,
and we get a good understanding of why he is so successful.

Vesper is very good at matching Bond's whits in their initial meeting and earns
his trust. Eventually they meet Mathis. Both these relationships are pivotal for
this iteration of Bond.

Fast forward to the first break in the poker game where Bond and Vesper hear Le
Chiffre being beaten by an African warlord. Bond is forced to fight the warlord
and his goons off, and with the help of Vesper is able to kill the warlord in
the stairwell. Earlier in the movie, we had this bit of dialog.

Vesper:

> It doesn't bother you; killing all those people?

Bond:

> Well I wouldn't be very good at my job if it did.

This is important for the next poker break. Because Vesper had most likely not
had a hand in killing someone prior to the stairwell scene, she is struggling to
deal with her emotions in the shower of the hotel room, where James finds her
sitting on the floor with the shower running. He sits down next to her, and
Vesper comments that she can't get the blood off her hands. In what I consider
to be one of the most beautiful scenes in the 5-part Bond iteration, James takes
her hand and sucks the "blood" off her fingers. This is the first time I feel
that the depth of the Daniel Craig James Bond supasses that of his predecessors.

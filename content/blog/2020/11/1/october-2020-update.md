It has definitely been a while since the last time I blogged...

<!--more-->

I have decided that I am going to try to do monthly updates. I figure it will
help my writing skills a bit, and it will give me an opportunity to reflect on
the month that just past. I figure I will try to get these out on the first day
of the month, and the blog will typically talk about last month's endeavors.

## Birthday Festivities

For those who don't know, my birthday was on October 26th. My friends from
college came into town, and we went to some wineries/tasting rooms in the
Driftwood/Dripping Springs area. Great times were had. Took my friends to try
the taco truck I always rave about, and they all really enjoyed it which means I
must have really good taste buds. We also hit up Mozart's on Lake Austin Blvd. I
am not a coffee person typically, so hot chocolate was my drink of choice.

TODO: INSERT IMAGE; I will have to figure that out lol

## Purchases...or Presents

For my birthday, I try to buy myself a present for it, _usually_. When I turned
21, I bought myself a calculator watch that actually just broke :(. For my 24th
birthday, I kind of combined my gift with my Halloween costume. The costume was
a motorcycle gang member, and the gang's name is the SoCo MoFos (South Congress
Mother F\*\*\*ers). I bought myself a leather jacket[^1] from FLAVOR Leather.
The material is pig skin, and it feels really good. The stiching seems high
quality, and I am definitely warm when I wear it.

Then I found a link to this non-profit called
{{< externalLink https://theoceancleanup.com/ TheOceanCleanup >}} which aims to
take plastics drifting in the ocean, and turn them into products. In turn, the
revenue from the products will fund more excursions to collect plastic and R&D
for other products. This sounded like a good business model to me, so I dropped
some money to buy their first product, which are sunglasses. I needed
sunglasses, so the timing couldn't have been better. I am hoping they will ship
soon, so that I can make good use of them, but I am also not in a rush.

## Projects

### Heterogeneous-Memory Storage Engine

I continued working on Python bindings for HSE. I am hoping that the bindings
don't need much more iteration, but feedback is always welcome. I am hoping the
bindings will be open sourced next month, but that really isn't my call. It will
be sweet to have a professional project on GitHub that has been largely created
by me. Hopefully it will gain some traction within the HSE community.

### Glovebox

<!--Patrick or Joseph...-->

While my friends were in town, "someone" broke my glovebox, so I will be working
to fix that next month hopefully. Gonna be awkward if the I get pulled over...

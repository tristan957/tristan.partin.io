This page used to use Plausible Analytics, but that is no more.

<!--more-->

Although I really like what Plausible stands for, if I want to continue to fight
data harvesting and user tracking at a personal level, I need to stop doing it
to my readers.

Because I use uBlock Origin, I wasn't even being tracked on my own site by
default. If I don't track myself, I shouldn't track you.

From today forward, this site will be analytics free. If you are interested in
privacy-respecting analytics however, Plausible is the company to go to. Their
co-founders are awesome, and their product is competitive.

Plus, I no longer have to spend money for my subscription that I almost never
used :).

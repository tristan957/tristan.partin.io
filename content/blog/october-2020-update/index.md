It has definitely been a while since the last time I blogged...

<!--more-->

I have decided that I am going to try to do monthly updates. I figure it will
help my writing skills a bit, and it will give me an opportunity to reflect on
the month that just past. I figure I will try to get these out on the first day
of the month, and the blog will typically talk about last month's endeavors.

## Birthday Festivities

For those who don't know, my birthday was on October 26th. My friends from
college came into town, and we went to some wineries/tasting rooms in the
Driftwood/Dripping Springs area. Great times were had. Took my friends to try
the taco truck I always rave about, and they all really enjoyed it which means I
must have really good taste buds. We also hit up
{{< link "https://mozartscoffee.com/" "Mozart's" >}} on Lake Austin Blvd. I am
not a coffee person typically, so hot chocolate was my drink of choice.

## Purchases...or Presents

For my birthday, I try to buy myself a present, _usually_. When I turned 21, I
bought myself a calculator watch[^1] that actually just broke :(. For my 24th
birthday, I kind of combined my gift with my Halloween costume. The costume was
a motorcycle gang member, and the gang's name is the SoCo MoFos (South Congress
Mother F\*\*\*ers). I bought myself a leather jacket[^2] from FLAVOR Leather.
The material is pig skin, and it feels really nice. The stitching seems high
quality, and I am definitely warm when I wear it. I have taken it for a
motorcycle ride in ~50 degree weather, and the ride was quite enjoyable.

Then I found a link to this non-profit called
{{< link "https://theoceancleanup.com/" "TheOceanCleanup" >}} which aims to take
plastics drifting in the ocean, and turn them into products. In turn, the
revenue from the products will fund more excursions to collect plastic and R&D
for other products. This sounded like a good business model to me, so I dropped
some money to buy their first product, which are sunglasses. I needed
sunglasses, so the timing couldn't have been better. I am hoping they will ship
soon, so that I can make good use of them, but I am also not in a rush.

## Food and Drinks

### Beer

The beer this month was plentiful and yummy. I explored more of the Blue Owl
Brewing Company selection through my local liquor store, The Austin Shaker. I
tried a plum marmalade sour which was really nice. I also noticed that another
brewery re-opened called the Central District Brewing Company. I stopped in to
to try one beer on a whim and my interest was piqued. I ended up taking a
growler of their kettle sour home with me to take to the Halloween party :).

## Halloween

Had an opportunity to go to a Halloween party hosted by one of my friends. Was a
really good time with friends I don't see too often. I don't regret going even
in the current COVID climate.

## Projects

### Heterogeneous-Memory Storage Engine

I continued working on Python bindings for HSE. I am hoping that the bindings
don't need much more iteration, but feedback is always welcome. I am hoping the
bindings will be open sourced next month, but that really isn't my call. It will
be sweet to have a professional project on GitHub that has been largely created
by me. Hopefully it will gain some traction within the HSE community.

### Glovebox

<!--Patrick...-->

While my friends were in town, "someone" broke my glovebox, so I will be working
to fix that next month hopefully. Gonna be awkward if I get pulled over...

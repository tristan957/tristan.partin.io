There has been a lot of talk of lawsuits against the two mobile giants, Google
and Apple, in an effort to stem anti-trust practices within the market.

## What is the market?

The market for the purposes of this article is the distribution of an
application on the target platform, in this case iOS or Andoid.

## Who are the consumers?

In order to get to the meat of anti-trust arguments, one has to understand who
the consumers are. In this case, the consumer is the application developer,
someone or something who wants to distribute their application for use on the
target platform.

## Logical Fallacy (TODO: header?)

When this topic comes up, I usually hear arguments along the lines of, "Apple
created iOS, they should get to do whatever they want on their own platform." I
want to touch on why this isn't a valid argument when it comes to discussing
anti-trust practices at this scale. It is important to remember that in at
least the United States, iOS and Android make up almost 100% of the mobile
operating systems on phones. As the owners of iOS and Android, Apple and Google
are in a unique position.

# tristan.partin.io

This is code used to create the [tristan.partin.io](https://tristan.partin.io).

## Comments

The site itself will function without JavaScript enabled. It has the ability to
show comments on the page using [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es), but
otherwise comments can be emailed to my
[public inbox](mailto:tristan957/public-inbox@lists.sr.ht).

## Theme

The site also includes dark mode support which will be handled by your system
preferences. Alternatively, there is a toggle if you prefer one theme over the
other. The option is stored in local storage as `site-theme`. Note the toggle
requires JavaScript to be enabled.

It is inspired by [drewdevault.com](https://drewdevault.com).
